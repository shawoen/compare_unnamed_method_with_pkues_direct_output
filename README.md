This program is a modification of a program written by Zhu Xingyu to compare the wavelet spectrum of current intensity calculated based on the Fourier transform form of Amperes Law (commonly known as inverse bellan method) with the wavelet spectrum of current intensity directly output by pkues, as well as the energy conversion rate and energy dissipation rate of the two methods. polarization.dat needs to be generated by the pkues program
